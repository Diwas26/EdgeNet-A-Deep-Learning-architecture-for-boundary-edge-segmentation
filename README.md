# EdgeNet-A-Deep-Learning-architecture-for-boundary-edge-segmentation
EdgeNet is a modified ResNet with specifics for pixel to pixel base edge segmentation. It is a encoder decoder based architecture which qualifies as the architecture for pixel based semantic segmentation.  The major model feature extractor used for the model building is Resnet. As previously also mentioned we used the Encoder-Decoder structure to reproduce the image of the same size as that of the input.  The Architecture is custom designed to handle major problems like Localization of the corners of segmented objects, handling large batches of data, Use all the features, i.e. low level and high level.  Besides regular skip connections we have made some extra concatenations so as to combine multi-level features for added accuracy.  Architecture designed is well conducive with transfer learning.
